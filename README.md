# Restaurant-Group-Data-Analysis-with-Python
The goal was to analyze a restaurant dataset, uncover key trends, and derive actionable insights. The dataset provided essential details such as the cuisines served, restaurant locations, ratings, and services offered.

Our analysis aimed to:

1-Identify the top three most common cuisines and calculate the percentage of restaurants serving them.
2-Determine the city with the highest number of restaurants and analyze the average rating per city.
3-Visualize the distribution of price ranges and compare the ratings of restaurants offering online delivery versus those that do not.

🔍 Key Insights Derived:
1-Top 3 Most Common Cuisines and the percentage of restaurants serving each.
2-The city with the highest number of restaurants and the highest average rating.
3-Visualized the distribution of price ranges across restaurants and calculated the percentage of restaurants in each category.
4-Determined the percentage of restaurants that offer online delivery and compared their ratings.
5-Analyzed rating distributions, uncovering the most common rating range.
Investigated the most common combinations of cuisines and whether these combinations influence higher ratings.

📊 Tools & Libraries:
1-Pandas for data cleaning and manipulation.
2-NumPy for numerical operations.
3-Matplotlib & Seaborn for creating informative visualizations, from bar charts to histograms.

By leveraging these insights, businesses can make informed decisions to enhance their services and offerings. This project reinforced the critical role of data analytics in uncovering patterns that drive performance.
Looking forward to applying these analytical skills to future projects! 🚀
